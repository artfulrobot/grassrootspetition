# Grassroots Petitions Inlay

This CiviCRM extension provides a tool to allow the public to create their
own petitions on your website, using campaign templates of your choosing.

It requires [Inlay](https://lab.civicrm.org/extensions/inlay) - a CiviCRM
extension that provides a framework for embedding functionality in
external (i.e. non CiviCRM) websites.

## About the docs


Documentation is split between the following types

- **Tutorials**: how to do simple things, prescriptive, step by step,
  learning focussed.

- **How-to**: guiding someone to solve a problem they know how to
  articulate or search via a keyword. Narrow and focussed.

- **Reference**: is written plainly about what is available and how to
  work with it. APIs etc.

- **Explanation** (discussion): educates users on the place and situation
  of technology and why it is in use and available.
